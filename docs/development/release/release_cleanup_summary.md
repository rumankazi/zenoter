# Release Strategy Cleanup - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Branch**: `fix-issues-with-release`  
**Status**: ✅ Complete & Ready to Merge

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Problem 1: Wrong Version Release

- **Issue**: PR #22 was released as `v2.0.0` (major) instead of `v0.2.0` (minor)
- **Root Cause**: Commit message contained `BREAKING CHANGE: none` which semantic-release interprets as a breaking change
- **Fix**:
  - Deleted incorrect `v1.0.0` and `v2.0.0` releases and tags
  - Reset version to `0.0.0` for clean start
  - Updated documentation to warn about this

### Problem 2: Release Strategy Confusion

- **Issue**: Initially tried to release from `main` branch, but this conflicts with branch protection
- **Root Cause**: Can't have strict branch protection on `main` AND allow semantic-release to push directly
- **Fix**: Reverted to release branch strategy (simplified and improved)

## ✅ What Changed

### Files Modified

1. **`.releaserc.json`** - Use `release` branch only
2. **`package.json`** - Reset version to `0.0.0`
3. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Trigger on `release` branch
4. **`.github/workflows/sync-release.yml`** - NEW: Simplified sync workflow
5. **`.github/workflows/pr-release-preview.yml`** - Updated flow description
6. **`RELEASE_STRATEGY.md`** - Completely rewritten for clarity

### Files Deleted

1. **`.github/workflows/release-major.yml`** - Removed (not needed)
2. **`.github/workflows/sync-release-branch.yml`** - Replaced with simpler version

### Releases & Tags Deleted

- `v1.0.0` (tag + draft release)
- `v2.0.0` (tag + draft release)

## 📋 New Release Strategy

### Branch Structure

```
main (FULLY PROTECTED)
  ↓ auto-sync
release (UNPROTECTED - automation only)
  ↓ semantic-release
GitHub Release + Tags
```

### Key Benefits

✅ **Full protection on main**: Requires PR, reviews, status checks - NO EXCEPTIONS  
✅ **Clean separation**: Code in `main`, version commits in `release`  
✅ **Auto-resolves conflicts**: Resets `release` to `main` if conflicts occur  
✅ **Industry standard**: Same pattern used by React, Babel, etc.  
✅ **Simple & clean**: Only 2 workflows needed

### Workflows

1. **`sync-release.yml`** (Runs on push to `main`)
   - Syncs `main` → `release` branch
   - Auto-creates `release` branch if missing
   - Auto-resolves merge conflicts

2. **`release.yml`** (Runs on push to `release`)
   - Runs semantic-release
   - Creates tags and GitHub Releases
   - Builds Windows installer for major releases only

3. **`pr-release-preview.yml`** (Runs on PRs to `main`)
   - Shows what release will be created
   - Lists all commits included
   - Shows version bump type

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Merge This PR

```bash
git push origin fix-issues-with-release
# Create PR to main
# Merge PR
```

### 2. Set Up Branch Protection on Main

Go to: **Settings** → **Branches** → **Add rule** for `main`

**Required settings**:

- ✅ Require a pull request before merging
- ✅ Require approvals: 1
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings

### 3. Keep Release Branch Unprotected

- ❌ No protection rules on `release` branch
- This allows GitHub Actions to push version commits

### 4. First Real Release

After merging this PR, the next PR with `feat:` or `fix:` commits will trigger the first real release: `v0.1.0`

## 📚 Important Notes

### Avoid Accidental Major Releases

❌ **DON'T DO THIS**:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add feature

BREAKING CHANGE: none"
```

Even `BREAKING CHANGE: none` triggers a major release!

✅ **DO THIS INSTEAD**:

```bash
# For features (minor release)
git commit -m "feat: add feature"

# For breaking changes (major release)
git commit -m "feat!: breaking change

BREAKING CHANGE: Actual description of what broke"
```

### Release Types

- `feat:` → Minor (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
- `fix:` → Patch (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Major (0.1.0 → 1.0.0) + Installer

### Windows Installer

- **Only built for major releases** (v1.0.0, v2.0.0, etc.)
- **NOT built for v0.x.x releases** (we're still in MVP phase)
