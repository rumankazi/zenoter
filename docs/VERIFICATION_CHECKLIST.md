## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check File System

```bash
# Verify all files were renamed
cd /d/Projects/zenoter/docs/development

# Should see lowercase files
ls -la | grep -E "plan.md|release/|fixes/"

# Should NOT see uppercase files
ls -la | grep -E "PLAN.md|RELEASE_|BUILD_FIX" && echo "ERROR: Uppercase files still exist!" || echo "‚úÖ All files renamed"
```

### 2. Test Documentation Build

```bash
cd /d/Projects/zenoter/docs

# Build documentation
pnpm docs:build

# Expected output: Successful build with no errors
```

### 3. Test Documentation Dev Server

```bash
cd /d/Projects/zenoter/docs

# Start dev server
pnpm docs:dev

# Open browser to: http://localhost:5173/zenoter/
# Manual checks:
# - Home page loads
# - Navigation bar shows correct items
# - Development section shows all subsections
# - All links work (no 404s)
# - Sidebar navigation works
```

### 4. Verify Links

Test these URLs locally:

- [ ] `/` - Home page
- [ ] `/roadmap` - Roadmap
- [ ] `/guide/getting-started` - Getting Started
- [ ] `/features/overview` - Features
- [ ] `/development/architecture` - Architecture
- [ ] `/development/plan` - Development Plan (renamed)
- [ ] `/development/animations` - Animations
- [ ] `/development/release-workflow` - Release Workflow
- [ ] `/development/pr-qualification` - PR Qualification
- [ ] `/development/releases` - Releases
- [ ] `/development/workflows/smart-artifact-verification` - Smart Artifact Verification
- [ ] `/development/code-signing` - Code Signing
- [ ] `/development/fixes/build_fix_summary` - Build Fixes (renamed)
- [ ] `/development/release/release_strategy` - Release Strategy (renamed)
- [ ] `/development/release/release_setup` - Release Setup (renamed)
- [ ] `/development/release/release_improvements` - Release Improvements (renamed)
- [ ] `/development/release/release_fix` - Release Fix (renamed)
- [ ] `/development/release/release_cleanup_summary` - Release Cleanup (renamed)
- [ ] `/development/release/workflow_comparison` - Workflow Comparison (renamed)

### 5. Check for Broken Internal Links

```bash
# Search for references to old uppercase filenames in content
cd /d/Projects/zenoter/docs

# Should return minimal results (only in REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md)
grep -r "PLAN\.md" . --include="*.md" | grep -v REFACTORING
grep -r "RELEASE_" . --include="*.md" | grep -v REFACTORING
grep -r "BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY" . --include="*.md" | grep -v REFACTORING
grep -r "WORKFLOW_COMPARISON" . --include="*.md" | grep -v REFACTORING
```

### 6. TypeScript Validation

```bash
cd /d/Projects/zenoter/docs

# Check for TypeScript errors in config
npx tsc --noEmit .vitepress/config.ts

# Expected: No errors
```

## üéØ Quick Test Commands

Run all verification steps:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /d/Projects/zenoter/docs

echo "üîç Step 1: Checking for uppercase files..."
if ls development/*.md | grep -E "PLAN|RELEASE|BUILD" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "‚ùå FAILED: Uppercase files still exist"
else
    echo "‚úÖ PASSED: All files renamed"
fi

echo ""
echo "üîç Step 2: Checking TypeScript config..."
if npx tsc --noEmit .vitepress/config.ts 2>&1 | grep -i error > /dev/null; then
    echo "‚ùå FAILED: TypeScript errors in config"
else
    echo "‚úÖ PASSED: No TypeScript errors"
fi

echo ""
echo "üîç Step 3: Building documentation..."
if pnpm docs:build > /tmp/docs-build.log 2>&1; then
    echo "‚úÖ PASSED: Documentation built successfully"
else
    echo "‚ùå FAILED: Build errors"
    cat /tmp/docs-build.log
fi

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Verification complete!"
```
