# Release System Improvements - Summary

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Merge Conflict Detection & Resolution

**Problem**: Merging main → release could fail with conflicts (version commits, CHANGELOG)

**Solution**:

- Detects merge conflicts during sync
- Auto-resolves by resetting `release` to `main` (force push)
- semantic-release regenerates version commits and CHANGELOG
- `main` is always source of truth

**File**: `.github/workflows/sync-release-branch.yml`

### 2. PR Release Preview

**Problem**: No visibility into what release (if any) a PR will create

**Solution**:

- New workflow analyzes PR commits
- Posts/updates comment on every PR to main
- Shows:
  - Will a release happen? (Yes/No)
  - What version? (e.g., v0.2.0)
  - What type? (major/minor/patch)
  - What commits? (features, fixes, breaking changes)
  - Will installer be built? (Yes for major/RC)

**File**: `.github/workflows/pr-release-preview.yml`

**Example Output**:

```
🚀 Release Preview

✨ MINOR Release will be created ✅

Current: v0.1.0
Next:    v0.2.0

Artifacts: GitHub Release (no installer)

✨ Features
- abc1234 feat: add dark mode
```

### 3. RC Releases with Installers

**Problem**: RC releases had no installers, making testing difficult

**Solution**:

- Major releases now include RCs (v1.0.0-rc.1)
- RCs build Windows installers for testing
- Marked as pre-release on GitHub
- Manual workflow supports RC type

**Files**:

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Builds installer for RC
- `.github/workflows/release-major.yml` - RC option available

## 🔄 Complete Flow

### Automatic Release (with Preview)

```
1. Create PR to main
   ↓
2. PR Release Preview workflow runs
   → Posts comment: "✨ MINOR Release v0.2.0"
   ↓
3. Review PR knowing it will create a release
   ↓
4. Merge PR (after checks pass)
   ↓
5. Sync workflow: main → release
   → Detects conflicts, resolves if needed
   ↓
6. semantic-release runs on release branch
   → Creates v0.2.0 tag & GitHub Release
   ↓
7. If major/RC: Build installer (~5-10 min)
   → Upload to GitHub Release
```

### RC Testing Flow

```
1. Create RC via workflow dispatch
   Release type: release-candidate
   → Creates v1.0.0-rc.1
   ↓
2. Installer automatically built
   → Download and test
   ↓
3. Find issues? Create fix PR
   → Merge to rc branch
   → Creates v1.0.0-rc.2 with new installer
   ↓
4. RC testing passes?
   → Merge rc branch to main
   → Creates v1.0.0 stable + installer
```

## 🚀 Testing Plan

### Test 1: PR Preview

1. Create PR to main with `feat:` commit
2. Check PR for release preview comment
3. Verify it shows v0.2.0 minor release

### Test 2: Conflict Resolution

1. Let release branch have version commits
2. Merge new PR to main
3. Verify sync detects conflict and resets

### Test 3: RC with Installer

1. Manual workflow: Release type = release-candidate
2. Verify v0.2.0-rc.1 created as pre-release
3. Verify Windows installer uploaded (~5-10 min)

### Test 4: Automatic Release

1. Merge PR with feat commit
2. Verify auto-sync → release
3. Verify v0.2.0 created
4. Check no installer (minor release)
